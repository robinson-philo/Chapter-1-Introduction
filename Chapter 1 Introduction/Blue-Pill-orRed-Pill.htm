	<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The Blue Pill or the Red Pill question in the story of 
	the MATRIX echoes the old story from the Bible of the Western Religious 
	traditions and the choice of the fruit from either the Tree of Knowledge 
	or from the Tree of Belief in Everlasting Life in the Garden of Eden.</font></p>
	<p><b>The TREE of KNOWLEDGE or the TREE of LIFE </b><font size="2">(<a href="#The_Story_of_Adam_and_Eve_">see 
	text below from <b><u>Genesis</u></b></a>)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of the Garden of Eden were the tree of life and the tree of 
	the knowledge of good and evil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tree of knowledge was of knowledge 
	desirable for gaining wisdom of all things and of good and evil.&nbsp;Genesis 
	3: <span class="sup">5 </span>&nbsp;&quot;For God knows that when you eat of 
	it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and 
	evil.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&nbsp; The tree 
	of Life was the tree of Belief and the comfort of believing that one will 
	live forever.&nbsp; Those who chose the Tree of knowledge were expelled from 
	Eden and barred from getting back to the fruit of belief in everlasting life 
	(&quot;a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of 
	life.&quot;Genesis,3,21).</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">The purpose for offering this reference to the story in 
	Genesis is to raise the comparison of the choices being given: Knowledge and 
	Belief.&nbsp; There is no intent here to suggest that Knowledge is morally 
	incorrect or evil or sinful.&nbsp; The contrast is offered as between an 
	approach to life based on faith motivated by a hope of some positive 
	consequence or result such as everlasting life versus an approach to life 
	guided by knowledge.&nbsp; Some may criticize either choice as being in some 
	way incorrect or offering the lesser of a life.&nbsp; Some may even 
	characterize one choice as being morally incorrect.&nbsp; Such crticism is 
	avoided her as not relevant.&nbsp; The choices are presented here as 
	relevant to what Philosophy is about.</font></p>

	<p><b><span style="color:red"><font size="2">The RED Pill</font></span></b><font size="2"> is the path of Philosophy and Reasoning and 
	Critical Thinking and Science and testing.&nbsp; </font> <b>
	<span style="color:blue"><font size="2">The BLUE Pill</font></span></b><font size="2"> is that of 
	simple and uncritical belief and emotional decision 
	making.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shall it be?&nbsp;&nbsp; Education and the Liberal 
	Arts and Sciences are about the Red Pill.</font></p>
	<p><em><span lang="EN" style="font-style: normal"><font size="2">One of the core themes of<u><b> 
	The Matrix </b></u>is the concept that if you want to transform your world, you must 
	first identify how you have been programmed, decide whether the programming 
	is accurate, then decide whether to reprogram yourself.</font></span></em></p>
	<p><em><span lang="EN" style="font-style: normal"><font size="2">You will be challenged in 
	a Philosophy class and in many classes. How will you respond to the 
	challenge that education poses to your beliefs, to your blue pill world?</font></span></em></p>
	<p><font size="2">As a simple start to the Red Pill path or some further 
	steps along that path you might&nbsp; go to&nbsp;<b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com">http://www.snopes.com</a></b> 
	and find five of the beliefs that you have held to be true that are not true 
	and you have just learned that they are not true by going to this site.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Another exercise would be to realize that you already 
	should be aware that things are not always as they appear to be or as we are 
	led to believe. Name one such thing in your life.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">This should open up to the possibility that&nbsp;not all 
	beliefs that we hold to be&nbsp;true are actually true and that it might bestinguish them 
	from others with less support.&nbsp;&nbsp; Philosophy is a method for doing that 
	examination concerning some of the most basic questions and issues human 
	have ever confronted.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">WARNING: the dangers of&nbsp; the Blue Pill</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Thinking that the Blue Pill is the way to go, the Blue 
	Pill will provide you with comfort and security and stability and order will 
	involve great costs to those that use that approach to life.&nbsp; It will 
	imperil a society dominated by this type of uncritical thinking.&nbsp; It 
	exposes those who use it to greater risks of infections and diseases as they 
	will not use the latest scientific findings about the causes of illnesses 
	and the spread of disease. It permits people to hold stereotypical and 
	prejudicial notions of other peoples and to act on false claims.&nbsp; It 
	supports racist and sexist ideas and practices and other forms of irrational 
	discriminations and injustices based on uncritical beliefs. It subjects 
	practitioners of the Blue Pill path to victimization by charlatans and 
	hucksters and those that operate ponzi schemes based on irrational hope. The 
	Blue Pill path is attractive to those with concern for self over others and 
	for the present over the long term but it too often proves to be quite the 
	opposite of what was hoped for when choosing the Blue Pill.</font></p>
	<p><b>BELIEF and DOUBT</b></p>
	<p><em><font size="2"><span style="font-style: normal">Belief and Doubt are 
	opposing psychological states.&nbsp; They can not exist with regard to the same 
	idea at the same time.</span></font></em></p>
	<p><em><font size="2"><span style="font-style: normal">Philosophy rests on a 
	Process of Inquiry using the dialectical method for thought.&nbsp; INQUIRY 
	is a process the mind can enter into to get from doubt to belief.</span></font></em></p>
	<p><em><font size="2"><span style="font-style: normal">For the method and 
	the frame of mind of Philosophy whatever&nbsp; position is arrived at should 
	be subject to continuing process of inquiry and examination.</span></font></em></p>
	<p><em><font size="2"><span style="font-style: normal">You can not doubt 
	your doubts.&nbsp; You can subject doubt to inquiry in order to resolve it one 
	way or another and arrive at a belief.</span></font></em></p>
	<p><em><font size="2"><span style="font-style: normal">You can doubt or 
	question a belief and subject it to critical examination.&nbsp; You can not 
	believe a doubt.&nbsp; You simply doubt.</span></font></em></p>
	<p><em><font size="2"><span style="font-style: normal">So, Philosophy is 
	about thinking about beliefs and settling on a belief using reasoning and 
	evidence wherever possible.&nbsp; It is also about continuing the process of 
	review of beliefs or positions taken using the continuing dialectical 
	method in the midst of a community of inquirers that serve to reinforce the 
	critical element in careful thinking..</span></font></em></p>
