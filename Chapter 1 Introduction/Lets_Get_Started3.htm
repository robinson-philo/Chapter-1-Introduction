<p>
Ok.  Over the years I have heard a lot of answers to the question:</p>

<p>What do you think Philosophy is?</p>

<p>Let me list a few that are not correct. Some are very off the mark and others are only partially correct.</p>

<p>Student attempts to define philosophy</p>

<p>1.        Logical reasoning to answer any questions or problems.</p>

<p>2.        Means by which to view and encounter life.</p>

<p>3.        A system of beliefs and behaviors based upon experience and judgment.</p>

<p>4.        Different views and beliefs that people have.</p>

<p>5.        Just personal opinions</p>

<p>6.        Logical thinking or reasoning, taking into account all that is known  to be convincing</p>

<p>7.        A frame of mind</p>

<p>8.        A way of viewing the world and handling life’s experiences and explaining it.</p>

<p>9.        Great thinkers thought and ideas.</p>

<p>10.      The way a person is able to maneuver their intellectual ability.</p>

<p>11.      A theory based upon moral codes and reasoning.</p>

<p>12.      Study of one’s thoughts without the impact of external opinions.</p>

<p>13.      Someone’s ideas and outlook on life or anything.</p>

<p>14.      Someone’s point of view.</p>

<p>15.      The art of reasoning, thinking and discussing.</p>

<p>16.      Logic, knowledge, a body of principles to follow.</p>

<p>17.      A discipline of thinking, which involves moral reasoning, logic and principles.</p>

<p>18.      View or Opinion or Belief or Theory</p>

<p>19.      Ability to think and make your own judgments.</p>

<p>20.      Things I live by.</p>

<p>21.       A belief, way of life or religion.</p>

<p>22.       A way of Life</p>

<p>23.       A translation of the complexities from all angles and summarizing it to its simplistic terms.</p>

<p>24.       The way the individual interprets ort rationalizes what is encountered.</p>

<p>25.        Analyzing, questioning, discussing and thinking.</p>

<p>26.        Information handed down from generation to generation: Beliefs, stories, rituals, and experiences</p>

<p>It is possible that I will be adding additional attempts at an initial definition to this list.  Students and readers continue to surprise me with answers to questions such as this one.  Some of the answers appear as if the answerer did go to some dictionary or reference work while others appear to be very direct and simplistic.  </p>
<p>
Now I do not want to start this introduction to Philosophy by giving you a clear definition of what Philosophy is.  Instead, I shall tell you a great deal about it, most of which you will forget.  Then, I’ll show you some examples of Philosophy in the writings of Philosophers on the major issues Philosophers have been thinking about for over two thousand years,  much of which you will remember, if only vaguely.  Finally, I’ll attempt to engage you in doing philosophy through the discussions and presentations of various positions on many of the issues and then I think you will understand both what philosophy is and some of the most challenging and recurring issues with which philosophy has dealt and continues to pursue.  </p>

<h3>A Text book Definition of Philosophy:</h3>

<p>Philosophy is an activity whose guiding principle is reason and whose goal is a critical self understanding. - -Robert Paul Wolff</p>

<p>Here is the dictionary approach:</p>

<p><b>PHILOSOPHY</b></p>

<p>1. all learning exclusive of the technical
</p><p>

2. pursuit after wisdom
</p><p>

   search for general understanding of values and reality by chiefly speculative means
</p><p>

   an analysis of the grounds and concepts expressing fundamental beliefs
</p><p>

3. a system of philosophical concepts
</p><p>

4. a theory underlying or regarding a sphere of activity or thought
</p><p>

5. the most general beliefs, concepts and attitudes of an individual or group
</p><p>

                                        ------ Webster's 9th New Collegiate
</p><p>

1. pursuit of wisdom; knowledge of things & their causes, whether theoretical or practical
</p><p>

9. the system which a person forms for the conduct of life
</p><p>

                                       ------- Oxford English Dictionary
</p><p>

 Robert Paul Wolff:
</p><p>

Philosophy: love of wisdom
</p><p>

the systematic, critical examination of the way in which we judge, evaluate, and act, with the aim of making ourselves wiser, more self reflective, and therefore better men and women.
</p><p>

Wisdom: rational insight into the principles of thought and action.  
</p><p>

Philosophy:
</p><p>

a.) conceptual analysis and armchair speculation on whatever other sciences haven't yet claimed as their own domain.
</p><p>

b.) systematic reflection of the mind on the criteria of right thought and right action.
</p><p>

Ok?  That’s quite a few definitions for anyone to ponder.  My favorite is still to come.  Consider now some things associated with Philosophy.

</p><p>

a sense of the limits of human knowledge
</p><p>

a sense of one's self  
</p><p>

For college students it wouldn't hurt to think of Philosophy as a discipline that originates in the West in an attempt to answer the question:  How am I to live a GOOD Life?
</p><p>

PROBLEMS:    How to live a GOOD life in this modern, industrial, technological society?
</p><p>

And : How do I  answer such a question with less than absolute certainty?
</p><p>

FUNCTION of PHILOSOPHY for the college student, the undergraduate:
</p><p>

to assist one in answering these questions for oneself.   
</p><p>

All right, that will be enough of the telling about the nature of Philosophy without defining it.  In the next section I shall attempt to show you a bit about what philosophers do and it will involve you becoming engaged in doing a good bit of thinking.
