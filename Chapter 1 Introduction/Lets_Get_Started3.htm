<p>Over
the years I have heard a lot of answers to the question: “What do
you think Philosophy is?”</p>
<p>Let me list a few that are not correct. Some are very off the mark
and others are only partially correct.</p>
<p>Student attempts to define philosophy:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Logical reasoning to answer any questions or problems.
	<li>Means by which to view and encounter life.
	<li>A system of beliefs and behaviors based upon experience and
	judgment.
	<li>Different views and beliefs that people have.
	<li>Just personal opinions
	<li>Logical thinking or reasoning, taking into account all that
	is known to be convincing
	<li>A frame of mind
	<li>A way of viewing the world and handling life’s experiences
	and explaining it.
	<li>Great thinkers thought and ideas.
	<li> The way a person is able to maneuver their intellectual
	ability.
	<li> A theory based upon moral codes and reasoning.
	<li> Study of one’s thoughts without the impact of external
	opinions.
	<li> Someone’s ideas and outlook on life or anything.
	<li> Someone’s point of view.
	<li> The art of reasoning, thinking and discussing.
	<li> Logic, knowledge, a body of principles to follow.
	<li> A discipline of thinking, which involves moral reasoning,
	logic and principles.
	<li> View or Opinion or Belief or Theory
	<li> Ability to think and make your own judgments.
	<li> Things I live by.
	<li> A belief, way of life or religion.
	<li> A way of Life
	<li> A translation of the complexities from all angles and
	summarizing it to its simplistic terms.
	<li> The way the individual interprets ort rationalizes what is
	encountered.
	<li> Analyzing, questioning, discussing and thinking.
	<li> Information handed down from generation to generation:
	Beliefs, stories, rituals, and experiences
</ol>

<p>I do not want to start this introduction to Philosophy by giving
you a clear definition of what Philosophy is. Instead, I shall tell
you a great deal about it, most of which you will forget. Then, I’ll
show you some examples of Philosophy in the writings of Philosophers
on the major issues Philosophers have been thinking about for over
two thousand years, much of which you will remember. Finally, I’ll
attempt to engage you in doing philosophy through the discussions and
presentations of various positions on many of the issues and then I
think you will understand both what philosophy is and some of the
most challenging and recurring issues with which philosophy has dealt
and continues to pursue.

<h3 class="western">A Text book Definition of Philosophy:</h3>
<p>Philosophy is an activity whose guiding principle is reason and
whose goal is a critical self understanding.</p>
<p>the systematic, critical examination of the way in which we judge,
evaluate, and act, with the aim of making ourselves wiser, more self
reflective, and therefore better men and women. 
</p>
<p>Wisdom: rational insight into the principles of thought and
action. 
</p>
<p>Philosophy: 
</p>
<p>a.) conceptual analysis and armchair speculation on whatever other
sciences haven't yet claimed as their own domain. 
</p>
<p>b.) systematic reflection of the mind on the criteria of right
thought and right action.

	 <hr>
<p>For college students it wouldn't hurt to think of Philosophy as a
discipline that originates in the West in an attempt to answer the
question: How am I to live a GOOD Life? 
</p>
<p>PROBLEMS: How to live a GOOD life in this modern, industrial,
technological society? 
</p>
<p>And : How do I answer such a question with less than absolute
certainty? 
</p>
<p>FUNCTION of PHILOSOPHY for the college student, the undergraduate:
</p>
<p>to assist one in answering these questions for oneself. 
</p>
<p>All right, that will be enough of the telling about the nature of
Philosophy without defining it. In the next section I shall attempt
to show you a bit about what philosophers do and it will involve you
becoming engaged in doing a good bit of thinking.
